Mappings for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, licensed under Creative Commons 0.

## Disclaimer
**This project is not yet finished.** Most of the work done so far is through educated guesses by
observing the code base and finding either recognizable patterns or strings.
Using the mappings in their current state *will* result in issues.

## Contributions
Pull requests will not be accepted aside from typo fixes.
Submit an issue if there's something that you feel needs to be added or changed.

The reason why is that I wish to maintain a consistent style and avoid referencing other, possibly more restrictive mappings.
Effectively, this project is clean-room. I have not sourced any names from any other projects, i.e. Plasma, BIN, or Pigeon, although
I am aware of their existence. If you wish, you may use those as an alternative to Vitas.

## License
As mentioned previously, this project is licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
This means I reserve no rights, and you may use this project in however way you want.
